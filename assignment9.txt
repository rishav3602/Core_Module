Q2.The structure and components of a neuron include inputs, weights, an activation function, and an output. Inputs represent the values or signals received, weights assign importance to each input, the activation function applies a non-linear transformation to the weighted sum of inputs, and the output represents the processed information.

Q3.A perceptron is an artificial neuron with weighted inputs, an activation function, and a threshold. It processes input signals, applies the activation function to the weighted sum of inputs, and produces an output based on the threshold.

Q4.The main difference between a perceptron and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is the architecture. A perceptron has a single layer of neurons, while an MLP consists of multiple layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. This additional layering in MLPs allows them to learn more complex patterns and solve a wider range of problems.

Q5.Forward propagation in a neural network refers to the process of passing input data through the network's layers, from the input layer to the output layer.
